            Bikanervala, a name synonymous today with Indian sweets and snacks, traces its humble beginnings to 1905.
            The operations started out as a small sweet shop - Bikaner Namkeen Bhandar in Bikaner's old city area of
            Kote Gate by Shri Lal Chand Agarwal. The shop initially sold a few sweets and namkeen tuned to tastes of
            Bikaneris. There it found acceptance and the shop prospered.</p>
            <p>Having prospered and created a name for itself in Bikanerâ€™s old city area and neighbouring parts of the
                city, two brothers from the family set out in 1950, to write another chapter in Bikaner Namkeen
                Bhandar's story.</p>
            <p>The two brothers setup shop in Delhi's Chandini Chowk and started selling sweets and namkeen. Using their
                family recipes which were handed down generation after generation to them, the culinary experience was
                something the capital had not witnessed before.</p>
            <p>The shop was also called Bikaner Namkeen Bhandar soon became famous amongst the population for its Moong
                Dal Halwa, Bikaneri Bhujia and Kaju Katli amongst others. The brothers and the shop soon began to be
                known as Bikanervala by the people of Delhi. That's how the name Bikanervala was born.</p>
            <p>With a name given by the people, the taste and fame spread with time. To cater to this rising demand, new
                shops and outlets were setup. Bikanervala during this phase transformed from being only a sweet shop to
                a store that offered fresh hot vegetarian meals as well.</p>
            <p>Today, Bikanervala has more than 60 outlets in India and has presence outside of India in countries like
                USA, New Zealand, Singapore, Nepal and the UAE.</p>
            <p>Bikanervala tasted success in its sweets and restaurant business. With the world becoming more globalized
                and Indians settling far away from India, the family run enterprise decided to bring the traditional
                Indian offerings to Indians across the world and in the process also transform the industry and
                themselves. This led to the creation of the brand - Bikano.</p>
