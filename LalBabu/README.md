Tags Used:
In the Bikanerwala project, I primarily utilized HTML tags such as **<header>**, **<footer>**, and **<div>**for structuring the content. These tags helped organize the layout and sections of the webpage, providing a semantic structure to the document.

External Packages:
I did not use any external packages like Tailwind CSS for styling during the Bikanerwala project. Instead, I relied on the fundamental combination of HTML and CSS to create the desired layout and appearance. For icons and fonts, I incorporated Font Awesome using its CDN and imported Google Fonts.

Learning from the Project:
My experience with the Bikanerwala project taught me valuable lessons in web development. I learned the importance of planning and structuring HTML before diving into code, which helps in creating a well-organized and maintainable project. Dividing the entire task into sections allowed for a more systematic approach to development, making it easier to manage and debug.

Additionally, working on CSS properties and utilizing browser inspection tools enhanced my understanding of styling and debugging. I gained insights into how to efficiently style elements, troubleshoot layout issues, and improve the overall responsiveness of the webpage.

Overall, the project contributed to my proficiency in HTML and CSS, emphasizing the significance of a structured development process and effective use of tools and resources.
